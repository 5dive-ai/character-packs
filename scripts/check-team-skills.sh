# DIVE-2347 — every skill a shipped template requests must exist in the repo it names.
#
# DIVE-4196 MOVED THIS CHECK WITH ITS SUBJECT. The templates used to live in
# 5dive-ai/5dive and were graded there; they live here now, so the grading does
# too. A guard left behind in the repo the artifact departed grades a copy no
# customer reads — which is how a check stays green while the shipped thing
# breaks. The copy still in the CLI repo now points at that repo's PARSER
# FIXTURES and is explicitly no longer the authoritative run.
#
# A template declares each role's skills as bare ids:
#
#     writer:
#       skills: [5dive-cli, deep-research]
#
# That id is a reference into a DIFFERENT repository (bare ids resolve to
# `<org>/skills` via parse_skill_spec), resolved at import time, on the customer's
# box, months after the template was written. Nothing validated it — not the schema,
# not a test, not CI. On 2026-07-29 all three shipped templates referenced skills that
# were not in the repo, six references in total, and it took a customer running an
# import to notice.
#
# It stayed invisible because the failure is deliberately non-fatal AND ambiguous: a
# flaked fetch and a skill that has never existed print the same warning and suggest the
# same futile rerun. This script removes the ambiguity by asking the repo directly.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-team-skills.sh                     # fetch the live skill list via gh
#   scripts/check-team-skills.sh --skills-list=FILE   # grade against a list (offline/tests)
#   scripts/check-team-skills.sh --templates=DIR
#
# Exit: 0 all references resolve · 1 at least one does not · 2 could not check (SKIP).
#
# Exit 2 is deliberately NOT 0. An unresolvable precondition is not a pass: if gh is
# missing or unauthenticated we cannot tell a good template from a broken one, and
# saying "clean" there would reintroduce the exact silence this check exists to break.
